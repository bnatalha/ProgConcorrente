# Matrix Multiplication with Python

### Before executing
- you will need `python3` to be on your environment `PATH`
- change `mutiplym` permission to be able to execute it
  - just enter `$ chmod +x mutiplym` to add execution permission
- create the directory `../in` and put the input data inside it

### Running the program

To run the program, type `multiplym <DIMENSION> <MODE>` at your terminal and press enter, where:
  - `DIMENSION` is a number 4 <= i <= 2048 and i is a power of 2
  - `MODE` can be either `S` for the sequential version or `C` for the concurrent one
